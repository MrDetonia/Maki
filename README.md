# Maki - Discord bot written in Python
### The discord bot that does things.

---

## Running Maki
Maki uses Python 3.4 with discord.py. Install python3.4 and use pip to install asyncio and discord.py.  
To run Maki, simply run bot.py.

## Required Files
- You will require a Discord Application for Maki to use, the token for which should be stored in a file called secret.py:
```json
token = '<Discord Application Token>'
lfmkey = '<last.fm API key>'
steamkey = '<Steam API key>'
```
- Maki uses JSON files to store data persistently. These will be created automatically in a data directory.
